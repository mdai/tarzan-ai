### Background

In the Korean TV series - Start-Up, a young entrepreneur, Do-San (Nam Joo-Hyuk) uses an analogy of Tarzan and Jane to explain to Dal-Mi (Bae Suzy) how machine learning works. Watch the clip [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDiCGa1xtrQ/)

[MD.ai](https://md.ai) wants to help Tarzan AI learn Jane's favorite flower -- is it roses or tulips? In this example, we assume Jane only likes tulips. To train Tarzan AI, we annotated some example images of these two flowers as "Jane Likes ‚ù§Ô∏è" or "Jane Dislikes üòî" on MD.ai Annotator. This project contain 3 datasets, "train", "validation", and "test", and we'll see if Tarzan AI will learn to predict Jane's favorite flower using the test dataset. 

Check out the [project](https://public.md.ai/annotator/project/nxN1d4R6). You can `clone` the project on MD.ai, try to annotate yourself, and see if you can classify flowers better than Tarzan ü§ì
